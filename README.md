# TheCompillers
This is a hackathon project using pycharm and django, we had 24 hours comeup with a project from scratch and present to judge

Our project is a web-based school management system that connects students, parents and teachers, eliminating the need of paper consent forms and agendas. It allows for a deeper connection to the parent and teacher such as being able to see feedback and give feedback to the teacher. 

We used Python,CSS,HTML, and Javascript, also using databases
We worked off of 2 main computers, working on backend and frontend. 

Contributers:Montek Parmar, Issack John, Jacob Hazen, Daniel Nwaroh, and Steve Kanna
